<h1>Skin Disease Detection </h1>
  <div class="parag" id="para-graph" >
   <p align='left'>According to dermatology, there are two kinds of skin disorders â€“ temporary and permanent.While the former can be treated through various options, the latter can recur on and off and may need medication for a lifetime.
   Here we have developed an application which identifies 5 types of skin diseases based on their features namely:
   <ul>
       <li><b>Acne</b>-is a skin condition that occurs when your hair follicles become plugged with oil and dead skin cells.
</li>
       <li><b>Eczema</b>-is a condition wherein patches of skin become inflamed, itchy, cracked, and rough</li>
       <li><b>Measles</b>-is a highly contagious, serious disease caused by a virus.</li>
       <li><b>Melanoma</b>-is a type of skin cancer that develops from the pigment-producing cells known as melanocytes.
</li>
       <li><b>Psoriasis</b>-is a skin disorder that causes skin cells to multiply up to 10 times faster than normal. This makes the skin build up into bumpy red patches covered with white scales.</li>
       
   </ul>
